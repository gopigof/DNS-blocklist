# DNS-blocklist
A list of malicious sites(rather unapproachable domains) that track you across all apps and activity on smartphones

Smartphones are a beautiful amalgamation of sensors which generate huge amounts of data. But OS like Android don't keep much track of who is yeilding which data. This leads to a huge amount of services tracking you in the background without one's notice. 
Hence, one needs to properly protect themselves using at least a tool like an adblocker to limit their data breach and protect their privacy. 
The Xiaomi list was compiled using Wireshark, a few days time and adblocker like [Blokada](https://blokada.org/index.html).
